Welcome to the Weather Top
===========================

Weather Top Release 4 is an app that allows input and display of weather station data on an individual user basis. Initially, users can click “Signup” in the menu to setup a personalised login profile. Users can then click “Login” to enter their email and password. Once logged in, weather stations can be added to a user’s profile by entering the station name, latitude, and longitude. Each station can then be updated with readings by clicking the view icon (magnifying glass). Readings can be manually or automoatically entered for each station including weather code, temperature (degrees C), wind speed (km/hr), wind direction (angle), and pressure (hPa). The latest reading will be displayed in both the station view and the dashboard, including:
Weather type (including helpful demo icons)
Temperature (Celsius (min, max, and trends) and Fahrenheit)
Wind Behaviour (Strength (min, max, and trends), Direction, Wind Chill)
Pressure (min, max, and trends)
Users can add/delete readings for each station (via each station page), or add/delete stations (via the dashboard). An overview of all stations is presented in the dashboard, listing stations alphabetically and showing them on a map according to their latitude and longitude. The user’s details can be changed by clicking the “Profile” tab in the menu, including first name, last name, email, and password. Finally, an “About” tab shows the description of the app, while the “Logout” tab brings the user back to the start screen.
